
Q5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.

A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.
To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:
 EXAMPLE:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>FAVICON ADDING</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.icon">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
